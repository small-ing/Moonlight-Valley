Travis here, just going to log what I've changed between last class and thursday morning:

updated title screen with image generated by Midjourney (AI image)
Adjusted main menu fonts and button placements accordingly

put grass underneath trees instead of dirt, trees convert_alpha() on scale and have transparent backgrounds now

when grabbing the player and slime from the sprite sheets, only scaling up by 2 instead of 3 now, they feel more appropriately sized now

more tbd...
